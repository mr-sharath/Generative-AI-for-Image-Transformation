# üé® Generative AI Image Transformation Pipeline

## Project Overview

### Innovative Image Enhancement Workflow
A cutting-edge project demonstrating advanced generative AI techniques for comprehensive image transformation, integrating three critical stages:

1. **Super-Resolution with ESRGAN**
   - Upscale low-resolution images to high-quality visuals
   - Uses Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB)
   - Enhances image clarity and detail preservation

2. **Advanced Image Processing**
   - Applies sophisticated image enhancement techniques
   - Includes CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
   - Implements noise reduction, sharpening, and color balancing
   - Preserves image structural integrity

3. **Neural Style Transfer**
   - Applies artistic styles to enhanced images
   - Utilizes VGG model for feature extraction
   - Blends content and style features seamlessly

### Key Technological Highlights
- Dataset: FFHQ (70,000 high-resolution facial images)
- Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- Advanced GANs and neural network architectures

This project is built based on the **ESRGAN research paper**, which extends upon SRGAN by introducing **Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB)** and other advanced techniques like **relativistic adversarial loss**. Check out the original ESRGAN paper for a deeper understanding, but here we‚Äôll focus on the **model architecture** and how to implement it.
